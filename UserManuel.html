        <h1>USER MANUAL HOW TO SHOP ONLINE</h1>
    <p>
        <b>To shop online</b>
    </p>
    <p>From concert tickets to washing machines, groceries to holidays, there’s bound to be a website that sells just<br>
        what you want. If there’s a particular brand or store you like, you can go straight to their website or you can<br>
        visit a shopping website such as eBay or Amazon, which carry broad ranges of new and second-hand items. If<br>
        you’re a bargain hunter, you can use a price comparison site such as moneysupermarket.com, which lists the<br>
        websites that sell your product according to price.
        <br>
        In this guide, we’re going to show you how to find a product online and make a transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Step 1 : Search for a product using Google shopping</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Type the name of the item you want to buy into the search box of a search engine such as Google – for example,<br>
        ‘Roberts radio’ – and click Search or press enter on your keyboard.

        You will see a range of websites, from actual department stores such as John Lewis to large websites simply<br>
        devoted to shopping, such as Amazon. You can also use the Shopping option on Google itself. Clicking on this <br>
        will give you items available based on product reviews and price. You can also ask only for results available<br>
        in shops near to you by clicking on 'Available nearby'.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Step 2: Find an item you like using Google shopping</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you click on one of the suggested items you will see product details as well as details of the sellers <br>
        available. Do bear in mind that these are sponsored by the merchants and there may be other sellers <br>
        in your area or online.
